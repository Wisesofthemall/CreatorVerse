## Notes

In light of my first encounter with Vite.js and Supabase within my project, I encountered challenges while establishing a connection between my web application and the Supabase database, as well as configuring the requisite keys and Vite rules. However, I am pleased to report that I swiftly acclimated to the circumstances and successfully overcame these obstacles.
